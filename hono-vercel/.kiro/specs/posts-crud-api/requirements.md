# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for blog posts in a Hono-based application. The API will provide endpoints to manage posts with their associated metadata including categories, tags, authors, and content. The system supports rich blog functionality with relationships between posts, users, categories, and tags as defined in the existing database schema.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog administrator, I want to create new blog posts with all necessary metadata, so that I can publish content with proper categorization and tagging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/posts` with valid post data THEN the system SHALL create a new post record in the database
2. WHEN creating a post THEN the system SHALL require title, content, authorId, and categoryId fields
3. WHEN creating a post THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a unique slug from the title
4. WHEN creating a post THEN the system SHALL set createdAt and publishedAt timestamps automatically
5. WHEN creating a post with tags THEN the system SHALL create appropriate entries in the posts_to_tags junction table
6. WHEN creating a post with invalid data THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with validation details
7. WHEN creating a post with non-existent authorId or categoryId THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want to retrieve blog posts with filtering and pagination options, so that I can browse content efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/posts` THEN the system SHALL return a paginated list of posts
2. WHEN retrieving posts THEN the system SHALL include author, category, and tags information in the response
3. WHEN a GET request includes query parameters for filtering THEN the system SHALL filter posts by category, tags, or author
4. WHEN a GET request includes pagination parameters THEN the system SHALL return results with limit and offset
5. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/posts/:id` THEN the system SHALL return the specific post with all related data
6. WHEN requesting a non-existent post THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
7. WHEN retrieving posts THEN the system SHALL return posts ordered by publishedAt in descending order by default

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a blog administrator, I want to update existing blog posts, so that I can modify content and metadata as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PUT request is made to `/api/posts/:id` with valid data THEN the system SHALL update the specified post
2. WHEN updating a post THEN the system SHALL update the updatedAt timestamp automatically
3. WHEN updating a post's tags THEN the system SHALL properly manage the posts_to_tags relationships
4. WHEN updating a post with invalid data THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with validation details
5. WHEN updating a non-existent post THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
6. WHEN updating a post's slug THEN the system SHALL ensure the new slug is unique
7. WHEN updating a post THEN the system SHALL preserve fields that are not included in the request

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a blog administrator, I want to delete blog posts, so that I can remove outdated or inappropriate content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DELETE request is made to `/api/posts/:id` THEN the system SHALL remove the post from the database
2. WHEN deleting a post THEN the system SHALL cascade delete related posts_to_tags entries
3. WHEN deleting a non-existent post THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
4. WHEN successfully deleting a post THEN the system SHALL return a 204 status code
5. WHEN deleting a post THEN the system SHALL not affect referenced users or categories due to foreign key constraints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want consistent error handling and response formats, so that I can reliably handle API responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a consistent error response format with message and status code
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed field-level error information
3. WHEN a database constraint is violated THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
4. WHEN successful operations occur THEN the system SHALL return consistent success response formats
5. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL validate request content-type for POST and PUT operations
6. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all input data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a blog administrator, I want to manage posts with their tag associations, so that I can properly categorize content for discoverability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or updating a post with tags THEN the system SHALL accept an array of tag IDs
2. WHEN processing tag associations THEN the system SHALL validate that all provided tag IDs exist
3. WHEN updating post tags THEN the system SHALL replace existing tag associations with new ones
4. WHEN retrieving posts THEN the system SHALL include associated tag information in the response
5. WHEN a tag is referenced by posts THEN the system SHALL prevent tag deletion due to foreign key constraints
6. WHEN managing tag associations THEN the system SHALL handle the many-to-many relationship correctly
